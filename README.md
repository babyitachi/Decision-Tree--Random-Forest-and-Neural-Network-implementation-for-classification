# Decision-Tree--Random-Forest-and-Neural-Network-implementation-for-classification

Decision tree and Random forest is implemented on Bank Marketing dataset. Observations are marked and reported for train, test and validation accuracies.
Also implemented Decision Tree prning to avoid the over-fitting, to increase validation accuracy and reducing train accuracy.

Implemented Neural Networks from on the Poker Hand dataset available on the UCI repository. Tried different types of activation functions and observed the results.
